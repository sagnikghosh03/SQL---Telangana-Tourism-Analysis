# Telangana Tourism Analysis with SQL

Welcome to my Telangana Tourism Analysis project, where I've utilized SQL to merge and analyze data from the years 2016 to 2019. This project aims to provide valuable insights for the Telangana Government Tourism Department.

Tasks Completed:
Merged individual CSV files for domestic and foreign visitors.
Conducted exploratory data analysis to answer key questions.
Identified top-ranking districts, seasonal trends, and growth projections for 2025.
Highlights:
SQL queries for merging files and exploring data.
Window functions for ranking and analyzing trends.
Growth rate calculations for projecting future visitor numbers.
